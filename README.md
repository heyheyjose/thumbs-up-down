##### Requirements / Set Up:

If you don't have Browserify, Watchify, or Babel already installed globally, first do the following:

```
$ npm install -g browserify

$ npm install -g watchify

$ npm install -g babel
```

Then clone this repo and run the following commands:

```
$ npm install

$ npm run watch
```

If you already have those 3 installed, just "npm install" and you are ready to go!
